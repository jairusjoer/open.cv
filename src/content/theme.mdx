**open.cv** is a document-driven static site theme built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), crafted for clarity and purpose.

With a deliberately minimal design, this theme ensures your work remains the focal point. It offers a robust yet flexible foundation for your personal website, portfolio, or blog — honoring a clean aesthetic without sacrificing customization.

## Configuration

The main site configuration is located in `src/config.ts`. This file exports a `site` object that adheres to the `SiteConfig` interface, ensuring type safety and autocompletion. Here you can define global settings such as your site's title, description, and navigation links.

| Property      | Type                                     | Description                                                                               |
| :------------ | :--------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `site`        | `string`                                 | **Required.** The base URL of the website (e.g., `https://example.com`).                  |
| `title`       | `string`                                 | **Required.** The title of the website. Used in meta tags and header.                     |
| `description` | `string`                                 | **Required.** A short description of the website for SEO.                                 |
| `locale`      | `string`                                 | **Required.** The locale identifier (e.g., `en-US`) for internationalization.             |
| `datetime`    | `Intl.DateTimeFormatOptions`             | **Required.** Options for formatting dates (e.g., `{ month: 'short', year: 'numeric' }`). |
| `image`       | `ImageMetadata`                          | Optional. Default image for social sharing (Open Graph/Twitter).                          |
| `navigation`  | `Array<{ title: string; href: string }>` | Optional. Links for the header navigation. Hidden if empty.                               |
| `footer`      | `Array<{ title: string; href: string }>` | Optional. Links for the footer. Hidden if empty.                                          |

```typescript
export const site: SiteConfig = {
  site: 'https://open.cv',
  title: 'open.cv',
  description: 'Document-driven static site theme',
  locale: 'en-US',
  datetime: {
    month: 'short',
    year: 'numeric',
  },
  navigation: [
    { title: 'About', href: '/' },
    { title: 'Theme', href: '/theme' },
    { title: 'Style', href: '/style' },
  ],

};
```

## Content Management

Content is the heart of your site. All your pages and posts are stored in `src/content/**`. The theme supports standard Markdown (`.md`), MDX (`.mdx`), and Markdoc (`.mdoc`), giving you the flexibility to write in the format you prefer.

### Frontmatter

Each content file can include frontmatter to define metadata about the page. This metadata is used to generate titles, descriptions, and other page-specific properties.

| Field         | Type                                 | Description                                            |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| `title`       | `string`                             | **Required.** The title of the page.                   |
| `date`        | `string \| Date \| [string, string]` | Optional. Publication date or date range.              |
| `description` | `string`                             | Optional. Short description for SEO and lists.         |
| `draft`       | `boolean`                            | Optional. If `true`, the page is hidden in production. |
| `image`       | `ImageMetadata`                      | Optional. Image for social sharing and previews.       |

### RSS Feed

An RSS feed is automatically generated at `/rss.xml`. It includes all pages except those marked as `draft: true`.

## Components

To make your content more dynamic, the theme includes custom components located in `src/components/`. These components are automatically imported via `src/scripts/getComponents.ts`, so you can use them in your MDX files without any manual import statements.

### Available Components

The theme provides the following components that are automatically available in your MDX files:

- **`<PageList />`**: Display a list of pages from your content collection
  - Accepts an optional `filter` prop to filter pages by ID prefix
  - Example: `<PageList filter="blog/" />`

- **`<PageHeader />`**: Render the site header with title and navigation
- **`<PageFooter />`**: Render the site footer with configured links
- **`<PageNavigation />`**: Display navigation links
- **`<PageMeta />`**: Generate page metadata for SEO

All components are automatically imported via `src/scripts/getComponents.ts`, so you can use them in your MDX files without any manual import statements.

## Print Support

In an age of digital consumption, print is often an afterthought. However, open.cv is designed with print in mind. Whether you want to save a recipe, a blog post, or documentation for offline reading, the theme ensures your content looks great on paper.

When printing a page (Cmd/Ctrl + P):

- Background colors are removed to save ink and improve legibility.
- The layout is simplified and adjusted specifically for print media.

## Theming

Your site should reflect your personality. open.cv makes it easy to customize the look and feel of your site through a powerful theming system based on CSS variables.

### Pre-built Themes

To get you started, the theme comes with three designed themes located in `src/styles/themes/`. You can use these as-is or as a starting point for your own custom theme.

1.  **Aggregata** (`aggregata.css`): A clean, modern theme using Zinc colors and a sans-serif font. Perfect for a post-modern appeal.
2.  **Catppuccin** (`catppuccin.css`): A soothing pastel theme based on the popular [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) color palette (Latte/Mocha). Uses a monospace font for a technical feel.
3.  **Read** (`read.css`): A minimalist, reading-focused theme using Neutral colors and a serif font. Ideal for long-form content and blogs.

### Switching Themes

Switching between themes is as simple as changing a single line of code. Open `src/styles/tailwind.css` and uncomment the import for the theme you wish to use.

```css
/* src/styles/tailwind.css */

/* @import './themes/aggregata.css'; */
@import './themes/catppuccin.css';
/* @import './themes/read.css'; */
```

### Customization

If none of the pre-built themes fit your needs, you can easily create your own. Simply add a new CSS file in `src/styles/themes/` (e.g., `my-theme.css`) and import it in `src/styles/tailwind.css`.

A theme file defines a set of CSS variables that control colors, fonts, and spacing. By adjusting these variables, you can completely transform the appearance of your site.

```css
@theme static {
  /* Colors */
  --color-accent: light-dark(#..., #...);
  --color-background: light-dark(#..., #...);
  /* ... other colors ... */

  /* Typography */
  --font-body: var(--font-sans);
  --text-default: 1rem;

  /* Layout */
  --radius-default: 0.25rem;
  --spacing-default: 36rem;
}
```

### Syntax Highlighting

For code blocks, open.cv uses [Shiki](https://shiki.style/), a beautiful and powerful syntax highlighter. You can configure the syntax highlighting theme in `astro.config.ts` to match your site's overall aesthetic.

#### Recommended pairings for pre-built themes

To ensure your code blocks look great with your chosen theme, we recommend the following Shiki theme pairings:

| Theme          | Light Mode         | Dark Mode          |
| :------------- | :----------------- | :----------------- |
| **Aggregata**  | `github-light`     | `github-dark`      |
| **Catppuccin** | `catppuccin-latte` | `catppuccin-mocha` |
| **Read**       | `vitesse-light`    | `vitesse-dark`     |

```typescript
markdown: {
  shikiConfig: {
    themes: {
      dark: 'github-dark',
      light: 'github-light',
    },
  },
},
```
